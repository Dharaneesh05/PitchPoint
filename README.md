Features

Player Performance Analysis: View detailed stats on batting, bowling, fielding, and overall performance for players across various formats (Test, ODI, T20).
ML-Powered Predictions: Integrated machine learning models (built with Jupyter notebooks) to forecast player performance, such as batting averages, bowling economy, or match outcomes based on past data.
Team and Match Insights: Analyze team compositions, head-to-head records, and match simulations.
Interactive Dashboards: User-friendly visualizations using charts and graphs for quick insights.
Data Management: Secure backend for storing and querying cricket data, with support for real-time updates.
User Roles: Customized views for fans (casual browsing), analysts (deep dives), and coaches (strategic tools).
Responsive Design: Accessible on desktop and mobile for on-the-go analysis.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Built with React (or similar framework) for dynamic user interfaces, styled with Tailwind CSS.
Backend: Node.js/Express server handling API requests, authentication, and data processing.
Database: SQLite (cricket.db) for lightweight storage, with Drizzle ORM for queries.
ML Integration: Jupyter notebooks (e.g., Cricket_ctipynb.ipynb, Cricket_bowling.ipynb) for model training and prediction.
