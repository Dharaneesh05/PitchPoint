## Features

- **Player Performance Analysis**: View detailed stats on batting, bowling, fielding, and overall performance for players across various formats (Test, ODI, T20).
- **ML-Powered Predictions**: Integrated machine learning models (built with Jupyter notebooks) to forecast player performance, such as batting averages, bowling economy, or match outcomes based on past data.
- **Team and Match Insights**: Analyze team compositions, head-to-head records, and match simulations.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: User-friendly visualizations using charts and graphs for quick insights.
- **Data Management**: Secure backend for storing and querying cricket data, with support for real-time updates.
- **User Roles**: Customized views for fans (casual browsing), analysts (deep dives), and coaches (strategic tools).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with React (or similar framework) for dynamic user interfaces, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express server handling API requests, authentication, and data processing.
- **Database**: SQLite (cricket.db) for lightweight storage, with Drizzle ORM for queries.
- **ML Integration**: Jupyter notebooks (e.g., `Cricket_ctipynb.ipynb`, `Cricket_bowling.ipynb`) for model training and prediction.
- **Build Tools**: Vite for fast development, TypeScript for type safety.
- **Deployment**: Configured for platforms like Render, Vercel, with environment variables for production.
